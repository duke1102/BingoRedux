# BingoRedux

## Very Early Work In Progress; Not yet stable for use!

### What is this?

BingoRedux is meant as a modern replacement of the SpeedRunsLive Bingo System we all know and use.
In my opinion that system is really dated and not really well programmed.


### What is it made with?

I want the Bingo System to stay as easily useable and user friendly, so it will purely be using Vue.js as it's JavaScript Framework.
This makes it easy to simply upload the Bingo System to any webspace and use it out of the box in any browser.

- Vue.js 2.0 (TypeScript, axios, SCSS)
- Vuex
- Bootstrap 4


### Features

Planned features:

- Responsive Layout; Works on Desktop and Mobile devices
- Configuration file (config.json; ability to specify the URL for the Bingo Card Set, with fallback URL)
- Dynamic Bingo Card Sets (JSON files)
- Bingo Card Set Editor for easy editing and creation of Sets
- Import Bingo Card Set from a Google Sheet (Easy maintainability)
- Convert and Import existing SRL Bingo Card Sets


### Contributing

If you want to help out in any way, feel free to fork this project and submit Pull Requests.
I'm still learning Vue and I'm open for any feedback and enhancements you submit!
